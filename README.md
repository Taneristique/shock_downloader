# shock_downloader v 1.0
About:
Shock Downloader version 1.0 is a video downloader which helps you to download video only on youtube for the moment.The work on shock downloader 2.0 continue.It does not support .exe extension and works only on python so it must have Python with a version 3.Python 2 is not useful because the main module "pytube" does not support Youtube.After installing it if you face an error you should simply open a terminal which depends on what os you are using and  go to emplacement which this directory exists than you should write pip install -r requierements.txt on terminal and if program appears because of dependencies app will perfectly work.Otherwise please inform me about the bug.In the case version 1.1 realeses an install script(setup.py) and extended plateforms will be added.
